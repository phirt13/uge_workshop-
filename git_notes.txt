Pull requests are how you merge branches on GitHub

GitHub is a Hub of .git/ directories

You can push and pull commits to and from .git/directories

You can also clone .git/ directioreis to new computers for new paths

master branch is a label that git cfeates for us when we initialize a repository

Head is another label that git creates for us when we create or first commit

HEAD is *not* a branch

# creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

# shows us which branch is active
git branch
